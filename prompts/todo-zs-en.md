Provide a React Native code snippet for a todo list screen that adheres to accessibility best practices.

The screen has a list with at least three items, each containing a checkbox, a task, and a date. The list is organized in descending order by date.

Ensure the code addresses the following accessibility considerations:

- Sufficient text contrast.
- Proper labeling for screen readers.
- Adequate touch target sizes for all interactive elements.
