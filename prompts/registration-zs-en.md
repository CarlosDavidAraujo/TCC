Provide a React Native code snippet for a registration screen that adheres to accessibility best practices.

The screen has fields for first name, last name, email address, password, date of birth, and gender. Additionally, it includes buttons for “Submit” and “Cancel”.

Ensure the code addresses the following accessibility considerations:

- Sufficient text contrast.
- Proper labeling for screen readers.
- Adequate touch target sizes for all interactive elements.
