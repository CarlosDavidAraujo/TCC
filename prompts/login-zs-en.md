Provide a React Native code snippet for a login screen that adheres to accessibility best practices.

The screen has fields for username/email and password, along with buttons for “Log In” and “Forgot Password”.

Ensure the code addresses the following accessibility considerations:

* Sufficient text contrast.
* Proper labeling for screen readers.
* Adequate touch target sizes for all interactive elements.
