The menu contains navigation items such as “Home”, “Promotions”, “My Orders”, “My Cart”, “My Account”, and “Log Out”.

Ensure the code addresses the following accessibility considerations:

- Sufficient text contrast.
- Proper labeling for screen readers.
- Adequate touch target sizes for all interactive elements.
