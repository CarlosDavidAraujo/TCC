Provide a React Native code snippet for a profile view screen that adheres to accessibility best practices.

The screen has a profile picture, fields for personal information (e.g., first name, last name, email, phone), and buttons for editing and saving. Additionally, it allows the user to update their information.

Ensure the code addresses the following accessibility considerations:

- Sufficient text contrast.
- Proper labeling for screen readers.
- Adequate touch target sizes for all interactive elements.
