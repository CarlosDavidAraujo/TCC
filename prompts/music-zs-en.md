Provide a React Native code snippet for a music player screen that adheres to accessibility best practices.

The player should include standard playback controls, such as buttons for play/pause, skip forward, rewind, and a progress bar. It also includes a playlist and displays information about the current song.

Ensure the code addresses the following accessibility considerations:

- Sufficient text contrast.
- Proper labeling for screen readers.
- Adequate touch target sizes for all interactive elements.
