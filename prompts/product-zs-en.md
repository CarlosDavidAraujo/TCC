Provide a React Native code snippet for a product detail screen that adheres to accessibility best practices.

The screen displays information about a product, including its name, description, price, and image. It also includes buttons to add to the cart or favorites.

Ensure the code addresses the following accessibility considerations:

* Sufficient text contrast.
* Proper labeling for screen readers.
* Adequate touch target sizes for all interactive elements.
